## Project Description
- This team project was a part of Data Science 3000 at Western University. In this project, our team of 4 used machine learning models like Elastic Net and XGBoost on Canadian household data to predict how much income is spent on insurance and retirement, finding that demographic and spending habits are key predictors and that nonlinear models like XGBoost provide the most accurate results.
- Due to privacy concerns with using confidential real-world data, I cannot include the Python code or the written report on it.
