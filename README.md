Here is the written report my team and I did on the group project for Data Science 3000 at Western University. The project was about training various ML models to predict how much Canadian households spend on insurance and retirement depending on various factors such as their demographic and spending data. 
My role was to train the XGB model and analyze it, so I wrote pages 15 to 20.
Due to privacy concerns with using confidential data, I cannot include the Python code we wrote that trained the ML models, but the written report should summarize what we did comprehensively.
